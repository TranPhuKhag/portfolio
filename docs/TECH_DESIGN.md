# Technical Design — khang.dev Portfolio

## 1) Goals
- Showcase backend microservices work with premium (Awwwards-like) UX.
- Keep it fast (LCP < 2s on desktop), accessible (a11y), SEO-friendly.
- Editable by non-FE quickly via JSON in `data/`.

## 2) Architecture
- Next.js 14 App Router
- Tailwind for design tokens and utility-first CSS
- Framer Motion for page/section animations
- Lenis for smooth scroll
- Serverless Contact at `/api/contact` (Brevo integration by env vars)

```
app/
  layout.js          # font, nav, footer, cursor, lenis
  page.js            # Home
  projects/          # index + dynamic [slug]
  about/
  contact/ + api/
components/          # composable building blocks
data/                # profile.json, projects.json
public/              # assets
```

## 3) Content Model
- `profile.json` → about, education, skills, contacts
- `projects.json` → array of projects (slug, title, period, summary, stack, highlights, links, collaborators)

## 4) Styling System
- Fonts: Playfair Display (display), Plus Jakarta Sans (body)
- Tokens: `ink` (#0B0C0E), `mist` (bg), `accent` (blue)
- Blocks: `card`, `section`, `section-title`, `btn`, `kicker`
- Awwwards-inspired motion: fade/slide reveal, hover lift (`ProjectCard`), cursor follower, smooth scroll

## 5) Animations (Framer Motion)
- `Nav` enters from top on load
- `Section` reveals on viewport with reduced motion respect
- `ProjectCard` hover y-translation
- Page transitions can be added with MotionLayoutGroup if desired

## 6) Performance
- Images with `next/image` lazyload
- CSS generated by Tailwind JIT, minimal globals
- Avoid heavy libs; no GSAP unless needed
- Prefer server components where possible (pages are RSC unless marked `'use client'`)

## 7) Accessibility
- High contrast text
- Focus states preserved for links & buttons
- Reduced motion respected via OS setting

## 8) SEO
- Metadata in `app/layout.js` (title, description, OG image)
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` route
- Clean URLs for project case studies: `/projects/[slug]`

## 9) Contact Flow (Brevo)
- Serverless POST `/api/contact`
- Requires `BREVO_API_KEY` and `CONTACT_RECIPIENT` in `.env.local`
- If missing, endpoint simulates success to simplify dev

## 10) Collaborations
- `collaborators` field in `projects.json`
- For shared projects with Anh Tu Dev, surface both live/demo links and collaborators

## 11) Deployment
- Vercel recommended; Node 18+
- Set env vars in Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Preview deploys on PRs

## 12) Testing
- Suggested: Playwright smoke tests for `/`, `/projects`, `/projects/[slug]`, `/contact`
- Lighthouse CI budget for LCP/CLS

## 13) Future Enhancements
- MDX for long-form case studies
- CMS (Contentlayer/Sanity) if content grows
- Localization (i18n) for EN/VN
- Analytics: `@vercel/analytics` drop-in
